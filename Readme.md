### Autonomous Vehicle Fleet 

Following activities will be observed after clicking on the application. Activity here signifies page in mobile application. Activity login page, where the user key in their credentials. Map page is the activity 2, showing current location of the person and the autonomous vehicle moving on the road with xyz location. On clicking the order vehicle button, by the passenger, the vehicle changes its course and start moving towards the user. 2 mins before reaching, it notifies the passenger that itâ€™s about to reach. User boards the autonomous vehicle thus overlapping their coordinates, indicating that the user has boarded the vehicle. When the user is about to reach its destination the app sends a notification again that the destination is here. This flow has been decided so as to increase the user experience. It takes only 1 clicks to book a vehicle on Cerebro mobile application. Which has been a focus, to reduce the time spent by the user in booking the service. SOS features as mentioned previously is like a one-way messaging service between the fleet manager and the passenger to alert the fleet manager of any emergency or accident.
